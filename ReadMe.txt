BFS Search Problem

----------

To Run BFS_point.py:

1. Ensure that you have both NUMPY and OPENCV installed in your virtual environment
   Note: I used python 3.8 when developing this, if you encounter strange
         issues, make sure that your virtual environment is in 3.8

2. Open the code an IDE of your choosing

3. Set your project directory to wherever you want to output the .mp4 file

4. Run the code. Note, when start and goal are far apart, code will take a while to run

5. Follow the printed instructions and input start/goal points

6. Open the final_map.mp4 file to verify the results
